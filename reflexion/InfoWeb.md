# Choisir les technos du site : 



For a web app that doesn't require a database and loads all its data from the URL, you could consider using a serverless architecture with a framework like React or Vue.js.

React is a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces. It can be used to create single-page applications (SPAs) that rely heavily on client-side rendering. With React, you can manage the state of your app using components and hooks, which makes it easy to update the UI in response to changes in the URL.

Vue.js is another popular JavaScript framework for building SPAs. It provides a similar component-based architecture to React, but with a more template-based syntax that some developers find easier to read and write.

In terms of serverless architectures, you could consider using a platform like AWS Lambda or Google Cloud Functions to host your app. These platforms allow you to write your app's logic in a variety of languages, including JavaScript (Node.js), Python, and Java.

You could also consider using a static site generator like Gatsby or Next.js to generate your web app's HTML and JavaScript files ahead of time. This approach can make your app faster to load and more SEO-friendly, since all the content is available on the initial page load.

Overall, there are many different options for building a web app without a database. The best choice will depend on your specific requirements and technical expertise.
